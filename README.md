# hello-world
This repository is going to contain the projects I have of my class and incase I need to refresh my memory on how to use Java I will use this.

Well my name is Damian. I go to Nyit and going to major in computer engineering and electrical. I love to play and watch soccer and basketball as well as playing video games. I am from El Salvador. I'm hoping I can learn more from Java so that it can enhance my skills when I get a job ideally as a programmer.
